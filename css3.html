<p> Silent Hill 2 was released on September 24th, 2001 by Konami. It was released for PS2, XBOX, and PC.<br>
</br> It is a phycological survival horror set in the town of Silent Hill. You play as the main protagonist James Sunderland; <br>
</br> James lost his wife Mary to an unkown Illness 3 years ago. James receives a letter from Mary telling him to meet them in their<br>
</br> "special place" in silent hill. James drives to silent hill and tries to find Mary. Along the way he encounters many monsters, but the <br>
</br> the most notworth is Pyramid Head, or "Red Pyramid Thing". Pyramid Head is interesting becuase he is a representation of James's Guilt and desire to be punished.<br>
</br> Throught the game you meet many characters in the desert town, such as; Maria, Angela, Eddie, and Laura. All of which hold a clue and a hidden secret's in their lives.<br>
</br> The thing that makes this game stand out from the others in the series is the fact that as soon as these characters enter the town, the town with its supernatural powers<br>
</br> projects each characters subconsious as illusions into the environment. </p>
